                            For this simplified version, wash and chop up your cucumber in slices or quarters, however you prefer (if you want tips on how to quarter a cucumber, visit the Tips & Tricks page). Then drizzle with the vinaigrette dressing, sprinkle with some feta cheese and enjoy your cucumber salad!

                            Wash your cucumber and then slice or cut into quarters, (see the Tips and Tricks page if you don't know how to quarter a cucumber) then set it aside. In a bowl or container combine the soy sauce and spices and mix until well combined. Add in the cucumber and then stir/toss until the sauce coats the cucumber. Enjoy!

                                <li>Drizzle of honey (maybe about a teaspoon)</li>

                                <li>Powdered ginger (to taste, but add at least 1 tsp)</li>
                                <li>Garlic powder</li>

                            </ul>
                            In a microwave safe bowl, add the honey, water, and ginger, garlic and salt to taste. A little chili powder, cayenne, or chili flakes would also taste great if you'd like and have them on hand. Mix together until combined, then add in carrots and mix/shake the bowl until the carrots are coated in the sauce. Then microwave for 2 minutes, check on them, then microwave for an additional 1-3 minutes depending on your microwave. Make sure to cover your bowl and use enough water, this will help your carrots cook faster and not get dry. You may want to/need to add more in between microwaving if your carrots are looking dry while cooking. Enjoy!

                            I had this with chips one time at my mission president's house, but this would taste great with carrots too! Simply mix the desired amount of cream cheese and salsa together, then enjoy with your carrots.
