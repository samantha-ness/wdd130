                    <section class="recipe">
                        <p>Sometimes when you buy a fresh head of cauliflower or broccoli, it's just such an odd shape it's hard to know where to start. Here's a way to tackle the challenge:
                            <ol>
                                <li>General tip: cut it first; wash it second!</li>
                                <li>To cut it: starting from the outside near the stem, cut off little broccoli/cauliflower trees, like how you'd expect to see them on your plate--mostly the flower part with a little stem. Work your way from the outside to the inside until you've cut off all the outside “flower” part and you're just left with the stem, which you can discard.
                                </li>
                                <li>Place your broccoli or cauliflower florets into a colander or sieve and rinse until all of them have been washed--then you're ready to cook!
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <button class="accordion">Quartering cucumbers, zucchini and similar vegetables</button>
                    <section class="recipe">
                        <p>Don't fall into the trap of making slices and then painstakingly cutting each slice into four equal pieces! And at the same time, youll want to avoid making super uneven pieces. Here's a good way:
                            <ol>
                                <li>After washing, lay the vegetable on its side and cut into 2 or through 3 sections horizontally (<strong>don't</strong> cut it vertically from stem to stem first, this will make it hard to cut it evenly).</li>
                                <li><em>Then</em> take each section, and flip it on its end so that it sits vertically on the cutting board. Now that its a smaller size, cut it vertically into 4 even sections from top to bottom.</li>
                                <li>Holding these sections together with one hand, lay it back down on its side and cut slices, thicker or thinner depending on how big you want your veggie pieces to be.
                                </li>
                                <li>Once you're done you'll have a pile of (hopefully!) evenly cut quarters! Repeat with the other sections of your veggie and you're good to go!</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                    <button class="accordion">Cutting tomatoes</button>
                    <section class="recipe">
                        <p>Ever had trouble cutting a tomato? I can totally relate. 
                            <br><br>
                            Check out this article from marthastewart.com: <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8372937/how-to-cut-a-tomato#:~:text=Core%20the%20tomato%3A%20Using%20the,cut%20into%20four%20wedges%20total">From Slicing to Dicing, Here's How to Cut Tomatoes the Right Way</a>. She has some good tips and methods for cutting tomatoes in a variety of ways!
                            <br><br>
                            One tip of my own: For some reason tomatoes have skins of steel, so as the article mentions, definitely use a serrated knife if you or a roommate has one (the kind with the wavy blade). If you don't have a serrated knife though, try using the very tip of your knife to make a small incision to break through the skin, then start cutting your slices from that point. This is easier, and will help you avoid injuring yourself or smooshing your tomato!
